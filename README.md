GetSkeleton1200-or-960
======================

Sometimes the designer designs with the 960 grid and sometime with the 1200 grid . So, I decided to merge both grid into one single scss file. Then, you can call which grid you want with the $layout variable.

#####Example
---
`@import "_responsive-grid";`

`@import "_core-grid.scss";`

`$layout: 960;`


OR


`@import "_responsive-grid";`

`@include grid(960);`

#####Fit the 1200 grid into 1024/1140 resolution for the "lovely" IE


Obviously, the 1200 width grid will not fit into 1024/1140 resolution with IE. The trick here is that we use an lightweight plugin call [syze](https://github.com/rezitech/syze) - http://rezitech.github.io/syze/

Why? Because, we can use some .js file like [css3-mediaqueries-js](https://github.com/rezitech/syze), but I prefered to use class to target breakpoint.

---

#####Implementation

 To use syze, include this script anywhere in your page.
 `<script src="//rezitech.github.com/syze/syze.min.js"></script>`

then 
`syze.sizes(320, 480, 760, 960, 1024, 1130, 1180).names({ 320:'320', 480:'480', 760:'768', 960:'960', 1024:'1024', 1130:'1140', 1180:'1200' });`

Voil√†! IE will use the 960 grid. Maybe you will have to adjust your styles (menu, h1, h2, etc) to fit into this grid.

#####Class to use to fix your styles (CSS)

`.is960 / .is1024 / .is1140`

Ex:
`.selector { font-size: 15px; }`
`.is960, is1024, is1140 { font-size: 12px; }`

OR

#####Mixin to use to fix your styles (SCSS)
------

`.selector { `

  `font-size:15px;`
  
  `@include ie-grid { font-size: 12px;``}`
  
`}`
